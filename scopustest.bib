abstract={As a research team without architectural training, we approached a total of 22 experienced architects and designers in order to investigate architectural design practice with an emphasis on human wayfinding. For the main study, eight informers developed circulation systems for a number of case studies. Our graphical transcription method allowed us to systematically investigate the sketching and gesture activity as is typical in design practice. Our analysis reveals the early design decisions of our informers and links them to priorities and the resulting design solutions. Regarding our method we can conclude that it is possible to gain insight into the concepts and work practices of a visual domain or profession, even for researchers untrained in that domain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Based on a multiple case study on Service Design (SD) projects, we discuss different levels of SD's transformative impacts, associated with three types of designer–client relationships. In the ‘delivering’ relationship, SD informs service planning and development practices based on user-centred insights, while affecting physical service resources/technologies. In the ‘partnering’ relationship, SD aligns actors with the target users' experience while extending the SD impact, beyond physical resources/technologies, to human actors. Finally, in the ‘facilitating’ relationship, SD helps client organisations build their own capabilities for sustainable user-centred innovation, while achieving a wider impact on physical resources/technologies, human actors, processes, and routines. The contextual factors and implications of the designer–client relationships for SD practices are also discussed, based on expert interviews. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study was motivated by the lack of design knowledge in the area of systems design for collaborative services. It introduces a framework for developing service design goals and strategies to foster collaboration within a community, starting from an understanding of its collaboration network. Network analysis and an interview are used to understand collaboration, and a co-design workshop is used to generate design strategies to foster these relations. For validation, the framework is applied to a community enterprise in South Korea. This paper discusses: the meaning of a sociotechnical approach to collaborative service design; the challenges of co-creating sustainable solutions when empathy cannot be established with users; and the implication of the framework for service design in a sharing economy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Manufacturing companies increasingly try to innovate in their offers to consumers by creating more complete solutions that combine product and service components. However, shifting from a product-centric perspective to a solution-oriented perspective is challenging. The present study adopted a design research methodology and built on Service-Dominant logic, integrating the human-oriented perspective of Service Design with an organizational network-oriented perspective of Product–Service System. It creates a new Integrative PSS approach, evolves design models, and provides an application in a manufacturing industry. This paper details how the application supports the design of product–service system solutions from the exploration to the implementation stages, highlighting the physical evidence of service, and contributes to advance design research at the intersection of PSS and Service Design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper has three main aims. It argues that education is a surprisingly neglected sector of activity in research on service design and innovation and that greater attention to education as a service can shed new light on theoretical and methodological issues in service design and innovation research. It shows how a novel reframing of education activity – as networked learning – can enrich some critical areas of thinking about the analysis, design and evolution of co-produced services more generally. Finally, it identifies a family of participatory design approaches that are particularly well-tuned to the needs of service innovation. The paper shows how contemporary ideas on individual, group and network-wide learning can benefit research on services and service innovation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents a new service development process model for transport services for the inclusion of wheelchair users. In line with the principles of Universal Design, the new model aims to develop services for the widest possible range of users, including people using wheelchairs. The model is based on existing models, case studies in Brazil and Germany, and complemented with specific support material regarding wheelchair users, ultimately devised to guide the development of services that include such users. The paper illustrates a demonstration of the model in a real situation in Germany, with the development of a service for wheelchair users where early consideration of their needs results in clear benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},
